# Agent development log

Each PR that makes a substantive decision, design change or measurement appends
one entry at the end of this file in the same PR. Keep entries short and factual.
Earlier entries are history, not current instructions.

## YYYY-MM-DD — HL-xx <title> (#PR)
- Decision / change:
- Evidence: commands run and results (automated / scenarios / real agent / live call)
- Open issues or follow-ups:
```

## 2026-10-13 — Scaffold

- Decision / change: repository created with agent workflows (adapted from the
  Trail/teachAR delivery skills, hardened during the Stream Privacy Guard setup),
  plan, lanes, scenario definitions, human-owned thresholds, CI structure (`check`
  aggregate, protected-path guard, actionlint, Ubuntu and macOS build/test,
  scenario suite through `scripts/ci/run.sh`), Claude staff review on PRs and
  Greptile configuration. License: MIT.
- Evidence: `python3 scripts/check_agent_files.py` and actionlint passed on the
  scaffold. No product code exists yet.
- Open issues: plan section 12 open questions.

## 2026-10-13 — HL-01 Workspace foundation (#PR)

- Decision / change: pnpm workspace with `packages/{core,daemon,providers,agents}`
  and `apps/cli` (`hotline --version` / `--help` only). Exact pins, each at least
  two weeks old when pinned: TypeScript 6.0.3 (not 7.0.x: the native port is
  three months old and 6.x is the stable JS compiler), Vitest 4.1.11 (not 5.0.x,
  a one-month-old major), Biome 2.5.14, `@types/node` 22.20.4, pnpm 11.27.1 via
  `packageManager` and Corepack. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` sets `saveExact`, and
  `test/workspace.test.ts` fails on any `^`/`~` range, a missing lockfile, a
  package missing from the `tsc -b` solution, or a package overriding strictness.
  `.node-version` stays `22` (CI gets the newest 22.x patch); `engines.node` is
  `>=22.13.0` because pnpm 11 requires it, and `run.sh setup` warns when the
  running Node differs from `.node-version`. Build uses project references
  (`tsc -b`); `typecheck` adds a no-emit pass over every test file. Vitest runs one
  project per package and aliases `@hotline/*` to `src/`, so tests never read a
  stale `dist/`. CI only calls `run.sh`, so the `build` stage runs Biome, `tsc -b`,
  the typecheck and a smoke run of the built CLI. `package` stays a notice until
  HL-15; `eval` still prints `THRESHOLDS: NOT RUN` (exit 0 in CI, 1 with `--local`).
- Evidence (automated, worktree on Node 22.23.1 and 24.11.0, clean `node_modules`):
  `run.sh setup`, `build`, `test` (17 tests in 6 files), `package` (notice) and
  `eval` (NOT RUN) exit 0; `eval --local` prints NOT RUN and exits 1. Changing one
  pin to `^4.1.11` made the workspace test fail. `python3 scripts/check_agent_files.py`
  passes. Ubuntu and macOS CI results are on the PR. No scenario suite, real agent
  or live call evidence applies yet.
- Open issues or follow-ups: `pnpm exec` under pnpm 11 rewrote the lockfile after a
  manifest edit, so run `pnpm install` after changing a `package.json`;
  `setup --frozen-lockfile` catches drift in CI. The CLI reads its version from
  `../package.json`; HL-15 must keep that working when it bundles. Revisit
  TypeScript 7 once it has a few months of patch releases.
